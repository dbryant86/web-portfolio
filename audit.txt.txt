Perform a Design and Usability Audit

Is my navigation menu clear and easy to find on every page?

 Yes

Is there a clear visual hierarchy? (e.g., Are <h1> headings obviously more important than <h2>
headings?)

Yes

Is the text easy to read? (Consider font size, line spacing, and color contrast).

Yes

Conduct an Accessibility Check

2. Ensure every <img> tag has a descriptive alt attribute. If an image is purely decorative, it should have an
empty alt="" attribute.

Yes

3. On your contact.html page, double-check that every <label> is correctly associated with its <input> or
<textarea> using the for and id attributes.

Yes
