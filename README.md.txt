## About This Project

    This project is a showcase of my work as I learned how to code and design a website. 
    It has been a challenge to learn but very informitive.
    Seeing that before this class I had no knowledge of what it takes to build a website.
    But after learning the basics, it has sparked my interest into wanting to learn more. 

## What I Learned

    how to structure and style a website using HTML and CSS.
    how to organize files and manage project structure.
    how to create layouts that to fit different screens sizes and devices

## Next Steps

    I would like to add more animation to my page and make things look less like a 
    beginner and really dive deep into creating a great website and really learn more.
